# aicSR.

This is a forked proot-of-concept that it is have proper ability to:
1. Cache text and save them into the binary file though the encode.
2. Create ChatGPT typewriter animation enabler to represent the acting like ChatGPT.
3. Write the environment file. And contract them into "py"-formatted file (Python) through Dotenv.
4. Append echo into "py"-formatted file (Python) through "sh" module or "py-echo" module(?).
5. Apply Google Gemini API into "py"-formatted (Python) to properly aim into Google Gemini fans.

Combining these five (forgot requiring Linux or FreeBSD into "py"-formatted file cause the usable, you can run them in your OS such as OpenBSD, Haiku, Solaris, etc). The aicSR (stand for *A*pple *I*ntelligence *C*omputing *S*kinning *A*ndroid) is the experimental forked of EvanZhouDev's Apple Intelligence chatbot that append UK resident acquiring Android phone from ordering iPhone. This project bought these alternating of EvanZhouDev's Apple Intelligence chatbot:
1. Google Gemini (Apple Intelligence).
2. ChatGPT (EvanZhouDev's typewriter needs).
3. Dotenv (EvanZhouDev's API define needs).

Resulting these three. This project is usually unstable and cause the forgot of aicSR needs. Because i bother with EvanZhouDev's NodeJS living as it's written in *Python*.

## Requirement.

These dependency is optional-able to execute *"chatbot.py"* for gaining aicSR needs:
1. `fastprint` 🔵.
2. `sh` 🔵.
3. `bash` (Python module) 🟡🔵.
4. `py-echo` 🟡🔵.
5. `echo` 🟢.
6. `google-generativeai` (`ninja`/Rust required) 🔵.
7. `dotenv` (Python module) 🔵.
8. `env` 🟢.
9. `hpcomt` 🔵.
10. `distro` 🔵.
11. `git` 🟠🟢.
12. `git-lfs` 🟢.
13. `gh` 🟡🟢.
14. `python3` (3.8 or later) 🟢.

### Requirement roles.

🔵 = Python/PiP.

🟢 = Shell.

🟠 = Pre-optional.

🟡 = Post-optional.

## Licensing.

If you need recreating this to license than MIT License. [Try living that the project let you generate "LICENSE" file to represent Github licenses (and Gitlab licenses)](https://github.com/dscottboggs/cargo-license-generator).

This append Github license living in nodding of open-source licenses such as Apache License(?), BSD license (developing your own BSD required, but Apple have ability to develop it's own BSD without BSD license yet), GNU/GPL license (optionally able to develop Linux distro for understanding Linux reason), etc. And able to properly publish *"LICENSE"* file into your Github/Gitlab repo (over your FreeDesktop repo?).

## Contributing.

If you need recreating this to run in more languages. Simply open pull request with a new file named `chatbot.[language].py`. And merge them into your branch through Github Actions or CircleCI.

This represent languishing in EvanZhouDev's language gains to target EvanZhouDev's language forgots (inducing Hindi). Because they execute the purpose *"expanding language is ability to aim language-known users"* for appending EvanZhouDev's language knowledge.

## Disclaimers

This require Google Gemini API key and saving file system to execute `chatbot.py` (same with Bentheminernz's `chatbot.py`). Because this is hintly designed for Google Gemini chatbot runs that able to connect Google Gemini API key and prompt `chatbot.py` into Google Gemini responding.

The `/help` in `chatbot.py` doesn't make sense and instead revealing the possible problem of Python for no reason. `\osName` in `chatbot.py` encounter returning error code such as `1`, `2`, etc. And callback into Python warranty except Python seperate warranty.
